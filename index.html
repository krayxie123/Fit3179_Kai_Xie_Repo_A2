Setting higher thresholds reveals that metropolitan areas and regions closer to the city tend to maintain higher median scores. In contrast, regional and remote areas show much lower performance compared to regions closer to the city. This pattern demonstrates the correlation between geographic proximity to metropolitan centres and educational outcomes, which highlights the potential resource disparities that impact VCE performance across Victoria.

The lowest performing will be the south western region, where it displays much more schools that have lower university admission rates as well as having fewer schools that have higher university admissions, along with the lower percentage of 40+ scores in those schools.

These locations also demonstrated the lowest achievements compared to the other regions present. Also, they observed the highest rates of lower study scores.

                                    <strong>School Sector Composition:</strong> This pie chart reveals the proportion of schools across Victoria's education sectors. 
                                    Government schools dominate the landscape, serving the majority of Victorian students. In contrast, Catholic and Independent schools 
                                    represent smaller but significant portions of the educational system.

                            <strong>Key Findings:</strong> This comprehensive analysis reveals significant educational disparities across Victoria, challenging the state's reputation as the "Education State." The data demonstrates clear patterns of inequality that correlate with geographic location, school sector, and socioeconomic factors.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Geographic region differences:</strong> It is shown clearly that there is a clear correlation between higher vce results and tertiary applications.
                            Metropolitan areas consistently outperform regional and remote areas, with metro schools showing higher VCE scores and tertiary application rates. In contrast, non-metro schools show more variability and lower median performance.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Education Sector imbalances:</strong> Independent schools demonstrate the highest performance levels, followed by Catholic schools, with Government schools showing the widest range of outcomes. This reflects resource disparities and different educational approaches across sectors.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Regional Variations:</strong> Southeastern Victoria shows the highest performance, while other regions demonstrate varying levels of educational outcomes. The trellis time series diagram also reveals concerning trends of declining tertiary application rates across all regions over time.
